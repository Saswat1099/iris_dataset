# iris_dataset
This is a machine learning model used for classificaton of iris dataset. The iris dataset consists of 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant that are NOT linearly separable from each other. Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. This model uses K-nearest neighbour(KNN) algorithm to predict the category of iris class a given sample belongs to, with an accuracy of 97.3%.
